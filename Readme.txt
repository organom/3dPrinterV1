First try to build a 3dPrinter - based on Ulticampy v2
done as an introduction to 3d printing and to the maker world... should have started by something easier ;)

Materials: 
	- mdf 5mm (no 6mm was available in the store)
	- mdf 8mm for the printbed base
	- cork for protecting the printbed base
	- lots of screws
	- filament for the 3dprinters

Machinery:
	- MunichMakerLab lasercutter
	- MunichMakerLab German RepRap Neo
	- MunickMakerLab half working ultimaker 1
	- screwdrivers, hammers, hands & patience... lots of pacience


Lessons learned:
	- Use 6mm instead of 5mm  -- follow the design at all cost
	- Plan, plan, plan and then do
	- It will take much more time than planned
	- First make it work following the design and then iterate to make it better 
	(I wanted to have 2 fans but still keep the auto-z leveling, ended up with a mixture of different designs that didn't work...
	 I need much more experience before trying to make things "my way")
	- There will be always more cables then initially expected
	- Mdf is cheap but not very stable - printbed base bended like hell
	- 3d printed parts tend to break, print them stronger next time
	- Get more material than needed, specially screws
	
Starting now with iteration 2 -> https://github.com/organom/3dPrinterV2   
There I'll be posting the full progress, from materials used to day to day basis. This rep is only for historical reason and own reference.
