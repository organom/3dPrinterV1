My version of the Ulticampy v2
as an introduction to 3d printing and to the maker world... should have started by something easier ;)

Materials: 
	- mdf 5mm (no 6mm was available in the store)
	- mdf 8mm for the printbed base
	- cork for protecting the printbed base
	- lots of screws
	- filament for the 3dprinters

Machinery:
	- MunichMakerLab lasercutter
	- MunichMakerLab German RepRap Neo
	- MunickMakerLab half working ultimaker 1
	- screwdrivers, hammers, hands & patience... lots of pacience


Lessons learned:
	- Use 6mm instead of 5mm  -- follow the design at all cost
	- Plan, plan, plan and then do
	- First make it work following the design and then iterate to make it better (I wanted to have 2 fans but still keep the auto-z leveling, ended up with a mixture of different design that didn't work... need much more experience before trying to make things "my way")
	- There will be always more cables then initially expected
	- Mdf is cheap but not very stable - printbed base bended like hell (worse than iphone)
	- 3d printed parts tend to break, print them stronger next time
	- Get more material than needed, specially screws
